# Introduction

Vue Calendar Scheduler is a customizable calendar that allows you to display events with date and time.

The calendar also [emits events](/guide/events.md) when the user clicks on a day, an event or a time.

::: warning Events creation
Please note that the calendar **does not** include a way to create events.
The idea is to allow developer to adapt the calendar to their own needs, and the use of events leaves the door open to custom implementations.
